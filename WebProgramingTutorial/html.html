      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      creating web pages and web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
      of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects,
      such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create
      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
      links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
